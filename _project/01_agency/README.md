# Overview

The agency dataset is a credit rating used by funds and investors to assess credit quality in a country. The rating agencies available are Standard & Poor's, Moody's Fitch and DBRS.

However, moody's and DBRS's rating rating has a different nomenclature for each country, so it was considered the standard set on the [countryeconomy](https://countryeconomy.com/ratings) website. However, such standardization was only up to the C rating given that all agencies start to diverge from this rating down.

In addition, also based on the [countryeconomy](https://countryeconomy.com/ratings) website, a new column was created to map the degree of each rating rating of each agency. The data were collected from the [tradingeconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/) website by web data scraping techniques.
